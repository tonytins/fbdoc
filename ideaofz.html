    As a request a while back I had to answer where I got the idea of Z from. This is it! 
  </p>
  <img src="images/z_character_came_from.png" width="452" height="402">
  <p align="center">Well the picture is just the tip of the iceburg heres the rest. After I gave up drawing on tails and went through <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/19389470/">copying off of James</a> just to get a feel of what he was going to look like, sorta thing. I  realized I was good at drawing the Tails head better then his body  witch lead to <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/19429712/">eeeeeeq</a> later on. The hair not only did it come from <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/19164987/">My best pal ZC</a> by <a href="http://jamesrocket.deviantart.com/">James Rocket</a> picture but it also came from one of the hair styles from in Sims 2 since I always wanted that kinda <a href="http://tinyurl.com/8xc5r">hair</a>, realy bad. He needed clothing I realized that when making this charector <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/18844781/">at the start</a> he was going to need pants and shoes so I went with the "<a href="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b316/zc456/AOLTAILS.jpg">AOL Tails</a>," as it is called, picture would be my 1st target and I them both. The idea for the shirt actrully came from <a href="http://musachan.deviantart.com/">Musachan</a>'s <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/15768423/">sweater</a>.  Also the name Z, alone, came from our cat who had the same name or  letter I should I say. The whole art style thing came naturel as shown  above.</p>
